# Ruby + Markdown + Git powered Blog

[Maneki](http://github.com/nathanhoad/maneki/) grabs Markdown documents from disk, parses them into memory for meta-data, and serves them up. My reasoning is that Atom/Sublime/Whatever is great for writing articles and Git is great for keeping things organised. Throw Ruby and Sinatra into the mix and you have all the ingredients for an insanely simple blogging engine.

I'm currently using it to power my blog at [nathanhoad.net](http://nathanhoad.net).
