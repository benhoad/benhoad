Two weekends ago I competed in a 48hr coding competition known as [React Riot](http://reactriot.com "React Riot") with [Nathan](https://nathanhoad.net/ "Nathan Hoad's blog"), [Lilly](https://lillypiri.com/ "Lilly Piri's blog"), and [Taz](https://github.com/tarynt "Taz's Github")

It was the first time the coding competition has run and we managed to score well the Judges; winning the overall "Judges Favourite".

Our entry, the "Definitely Ending Story", was made as a throw back to early point-n-click adventure games we had grown up with. Some of my fondest childhood memories included solving the many puzzles of [Monkey Island](http://store.steampowered.com/app/32360/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island_Special_Edition/ "Monkey Island on Steam") and [Day of the Tentacle](http://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/ "Day of the Tentacle on Steam").
