After getting a few requests for an iPhone friendly version of [Athletable](http://athletable.com) I figured I'd move it up the todo list and get it happening. 

The interface has been redesigned for the mobile screen to make better use of the screen size.

A native app will be out eventually but for now it's possible to add Athletable to your home screen from Mobile Safari :-)
