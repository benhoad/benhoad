This is more something I wanted to use for myself but I figured it might be found useful by others - You can now track scores for single player sports as well as versus sports. In single player sports, Players will be ranked by their high score but a cumulative total of points will also be displayed for your own benefit.

I figured I'd use the single player tracking for gym related stuff but you could also use it for things like sales competitions :-D
