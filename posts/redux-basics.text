As a big fan of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) I was recently 
introduced to [Redux](http://rackt.org/redux/docs/basics/index.html) and, coming from a
history of various forms of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), I'm 
loving the concept. I definitely think my next React project will be using Redux.
